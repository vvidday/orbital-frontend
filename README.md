## About
Who Tweeted That? is an interactive web-based game where players guess the author of tweets from their favourite celebrities.

Many of us follow our favourite celebrities and internet personalities on social media, where they share part of their lives, interests and opinions with their followers. But just how well do we know them? Can we recognize these celebrities when the handle is separated from the content?

Compete against your friends and other superfans in this web game - it’s time to find out who’s truly the biggest fan.

## Features
